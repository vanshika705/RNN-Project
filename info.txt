RNN ---> Recurrent Neural Network.
RNN works on Natural Language Processing (NLP).
It is used to think, generate and response natural language processing.

NLP have two parts :-
1. NLU ---> Natural Language Understanding
   It will understand the input (natural languages).

2. NLG ---> Natural Language Generation
   It will generate natural languages.

GPT ---> Generative Pre-trained Transformers.

RNN is used to deal with sequential data.
Sequential data ---> Text data and Time series data.
Time series data ---> prediction which is done on the basis of time period.
Tabular / Structural data are not sequential data.

RNN Processing :-
1. When input is passed, it is multiplied with weight and previous output 
   because current input is depends on previous output.
2. It is passed through the neural network.
3. Input and output are english words.
4. All output are passes through new neural.
5. Loss reduced.

z1 = I.W + bias       sigma(Z1)
z2 = I.W.O1 + bias    sigma(Z2)
z3 = I.W.O2 + bias    sigma(Z3)
activation function ---> tanh
    It returns(-1 to +1).
